1. (OOP1) Write a program prog1.cs in C# that determines all prime numbers
    a. that are less than 200
    b. and greater than 100
    c. print out these numbers to the screen
2. (OOP2) Write a library lib1.cs that contains
    a. an abstract class Animal and abstract method bark() and one field name
    b. inherited class Dog and method bark() that returns one string “bow-wow”
    c. inherited class SheepDog (from) the class Dog and method bark() that
    returns a random numbers of the strings “bow-wow” but not greater than 10
    (eg. bow-wow bow-wow bow-wow bow-wow”
    d. implement that class in the program prog2.cs
3. (MPL) Write a program prog3.py that contains a function in Python
    a. that as a parameter takes an integer number n.
    b. returns an amount of divisors of n (eg. 12 has 6 divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12)
    c. implement this function
